10 coding practices: 1. Clear, Meaningful varible names.
Dont use varibles like x, or y when reffering to something like a name. 2. Using the === comparison.
Use the === comparison because == only makes sure the two values are the same. 3. Comment as much as needed not more.
Dont overcomment every thing just enough to know what going on 4. Use Shortcut practices.
shorten you code and make it more readable. 5. Stick to a strict coding style.
While haveing a lax coding style works, it may make it hard to transition to different enviorments 6. Avoid using global varibles
It's easy to overwrite code that you have written if you made all you varibles global. 7. Declaration at the top
Its easier for maintnence and finding a varible. 8. end your switches with defaults
Even if you don't think you need one it is still good to have just in case. 9. Avoid mixing with other technologies.
when using multiple technologies you can make your code slow. 10. Allow for configuration and translation.
If something changes, or gets deleted you will have an easier time maintaining the code.
